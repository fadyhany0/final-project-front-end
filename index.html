          specific antiviral medicine to prevent or treat COVID-2019. However, those affected should receive care to
          relieve symptoms. People with serious illness should be hospitalized. Most patients recover thanks to

        <p style="font-size: 20px; letter-spacing: 4px; font-style: italic;"> Antibiotics do not help, as they do not
          work against viruses. Treatment aims to relieve the symptoms while your body fights the illness. You'll need
          to stay in isolation, away from other people, until you have recovered.</p>

                On February 11, 2020 the World Health Organization announced an official name for the disease that is
                causing the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak, first identified in Wuhan China. The new name of this
                disease is coronavirus disease 2019, abbreviated as COVID-19. In COVID-19, ‘CO’ stands for ‘corona,’
                ‘VI’ for ‘virus,’ and ‘D’ for disease. Formerly, this disease was referred to as “2019 novel
                coronavirus” or “2019-nCoV”.

                A novel coronavirus is a new coronavirus that has not been previously identified. The virus causing
                coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is not the same as the coronaviruses that commonly circulate among
                humans and cause mild illness, like the common cold.

                People in the U.S. may be worried or anxious about friends and relatives who are living in or visiting
                areas where COVID-19 is spreading. Some people are worried about the disease. Fear and anxiety can lead
                to social stigma, for example, towards Chinese or other Asian Americans or people who were in
                quarantine.

                Stigma is discrimination against an identifiable group of people, a place, or a nation. Stigma is
                associated with a lack of knowledge about how COVID-19 spreads, a need to blame someone, fears about
                disease and death, and gossip that spreads rumors and myths.

                Stigma hurts everyone by creating more fear or anger towards ordinary people instead of the disease that
                is causing the problem.

                Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. Some cause illness in people, and others, such as canine
                and feline coronaviruses, only infect animals. Rarely, animal coronaviruses that infect animals have
                emerged to infect people and can spread between people. This is suspected to have occurred for the virus
                that causes COVID-19. Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
                (SARS) are two other examples of coronaviruses that originated from animals and then spread to people.

                This virus was first detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. The first infections were linked to
                a live animal market, but the virus is now spreading from person-to-person. It’s important to note that
                person-to-person spread can happen on a continuum. Some viruses are highly contagious (like measles),
                while other viruses are less so.

                The virus that causes COVID-19 seems to be spreading easily and sustainably in the community (“community
                spread”) in some affected geographic areas. Community spread means people have been infected with the
                virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected.

                The virus that causes COVID-19 is spreading from person-to-person. Someone who is actively sick with
                COVID-19 can spread the illness to others. That is why CDC recommends that these patients be isolated
                either in the hospital or at home (depending on how sick they are) until they are better and no longer
                pose a risk of infecting others.

                How long someone is actively sick can vary so the decision on when to release someone from isolation is
                made on a case-by-case basis in consultation with doctors, infection prevention and control experts, and
                public health officials and involves considering specifics of each situation including disease severity,
                illness signs and symptoms, and results of laboratory testing for that patient.

                Current CDC guidance for when it is OK to release someone from isolation is made on a case by case basis
                and includes meeting all of the following requirements:

                The patient is free from fever without the use of fever-reducing medications.

                The patient is no longer showing symptoms, including cough.

                The patient has tested negative on at least two consecutive respiratory specimens collected at least 24
                hours apart.

                Someone who has been released from isolation is not considered to pose a risk of infection to others.

                Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from person-to-person through respiratory droplets.
                Currently there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with food. Before
                preparing or eating food it is important to always wash your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds
                for general food safety. Throughout the day wash your hands after blowing your nose, coughing or
                sneezing, or going to the bathroom.

                It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on
                it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the
                main way the virus spreads.

                In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very low
                risk of spread from food products or packaging that are shipped over a period of days or weeks at
                ambient, refrigerated, or frozen temperatures.

                Protection measures for everyone

                Stay aware of the latest information on the COVID-19 outbreak, available on the WHO website and through
                your national and local public health authority. Many countries around the world have seen cases of
                COVID-19 and several have seen outbreaks. Authorities in China and some other countries have succeeded
                in slowing or stopping their outbreaks. However, the situation is unpredictable so check regularly for
                the latest news.

                You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions:

                Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and
                water.

                Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on
                your hands.


                Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing.

                Why? When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may
                contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if
                the person coughing has the disease.


                Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth.

                Why? Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus
                to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.


                Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This means covering your
                mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue
                immediately.

                Why? Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from
                viruses such as cold, flu and COVID-19.


                Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical
                attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority.

                Why? National and local authorities will have the most up to date information on the situation in your
                area. Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health
                facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections.


                Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19 hotspots (cities or local areas where COVID-19 is spreading
                widely). If possible, avoid traveling to places – especially if you are an older person or have
                diabetes, heart or lung disease.
                Why? You have a higher chance of catching COVID-19 in one of these areas.

                Household members, intimate partners, and caregivers in a nonhealthcare setting may have close contact2
                with a person with symptomatic, laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 or a person under investigation. Close
                contacts should monitor their health; they should call their healthcare provider right away if they
                develop symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 (e.g., fever, cough, shortness of breath)

                Close contacts should also follow these recommendations:

                Make sure that you understand and can help the patient follow their healthcare provider’s instructions
                for medication(s) and care. You should help the patient with basic needs in the home and provide support
                for getting groceries, prescriptions, and other personal needs.


                Monitor the patient’s symptoms. If the patient is getting sicker, call his or her healthcare provider
                and tell them that the patient has laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. This will help the healthcare
                provider’s office take steps to keep other people in the office or waiting room from getting infected.
                Ask the healthcare provider to call the local or state health department for additional guidance. If the
                patient has a medical emergency and you need to call 911, notify the dispatch personnel that the patient
                has, or is being evaluated for COVID-19.


                Household members should stay in another room or be separated from the patient as much as possible.
                Household members should use a separate bedroom and bathroom, if available.


                Prohibit visitors who do not have an essential need to be in the home.


                Household members should care for any pets in the home. Do not handle pets or other animals while sick.
                For more information, see COVID-19 and Animals.


                Make sure that shared spaces in the home have good air flow, such as by an air conditioner or an opened
                window, weather permitting.


                Perform hand hygiene frequently. Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or
                use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains 60 to 95% alcohol, covering all surfaces of your hands
                and rubbing them together until they feel dry. Soap and water should be used preferentially if hands are
                visibly dirty.


                Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.


                The patient should wear a facemask when you are around other people. If the patient is not able to wear
                a facemask (for example, because it causes trouble breathing), you, as the caregiver, should wear a mask
                when you are in the same room as the patient.


                Wear a disposable facemask and gloves when you touch or have contact with the patient’s blood, stool, or
                body fluids, such as saliva, sputum, nasal mucus, vomit, urine.

                Throw out disposable facemasks and gloves after using them. Do not reuse.


                When removing personal protective equipment, first remove and dispose of gloves. Then, immediately clean
                your hands with soap and water or alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Next, remove and dispose of facemask,
                and immediately clean your hands again with soap and water or alcohol-based hand sanitizer.


                Avoid sharing household items with the patient. You should not share dishes, drinking glasses, cups,
                eating utensils, towels, bedding, or other items. After the patient uses these items, you should wash
                them thoroughly (see below “Wash laundry thoroughly”).


                Clean all “high-touch” surfaces, such as counters, tabletops, doorknobs, bathroom fixtures, toilets,
                phones, keyboards, tablets, and bedside tables, every day. Also, clean any surfaces that may have blood,
                stool, or body fluids on them.

                Use a household cleaning spray or wipe, according to the label instructions. Labels contain instructions
                for safe and effective use of the cleaning product including precautions you should take when applying
                the product, such as wearing gloves and making sure you have good ventilation during use of the product.


                Wash laundry thoroughly.

                Immediately remove and wash clothes or bedding that have blood, stool, or body fluids on them.


                Wear disposable gloves while handling soiled items and keep soiled items away from your body. Clean your
                hands (with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand sanitizer) immediately after removing your gloves.


                Read and follow directions on labels of laundry or clothing items and detergent. In general, using a
                normal laundry detergent according to washing machine instructions and dry thoroughly using the warmest
                temperatures recommended on the clothing label.


                Place all used disposable gloves, facemasks, and other contaminated items in a lined container before
                disposing of them with other household waste. Clean your hands (with soap and water or an alcohol-based
                hand sanitizer) immediately after handling these items. Soap and water should be used preferentially if
                hands are visibly dirty.


                Discuss any additional questions with your state or local health department or healthcare provider.
                Check available hours when contacting your local health department.

                Only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms (especially coughing) or looking after someone

                someone who is ill then you are wasting a mask. There is a world-wide shortage of masks, so WHO urges
                people to use masks wisely.

                WHO advises rational use of medical masks to avoid unnecessary wastage of precious resources and mis-use
                of masks ( Advice on the use of masks).

                The most effective ways to protect yourself and others against COVID-19 are to frequently clean your
                hands, cover your cough with the bend of elbow or tissue and maintain a distance of at least 1 meter (3
                feet) from people who are coughing or sneezing. See basic protective measures against the new

                The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches
                and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and
                begin gradually. Some people become infected but don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most
                people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6
                people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and
                those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more
                likely to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical
                attention.

                Using the CDC-developed diagnostic test, a negative result means that the virus that causes COVID-19 was

                detected.

                For COVID-19, a negative test result for a sample collected while a person has symptoms likely means

                During an outbreak, stay calm and put your preparedness plan to work. Follow the steps below:

                Protect yourself and others.

                Stay home if you are sick. Keep away from people who are sick. Limit close contact with others as much
                as possible (about 6 feet).

                Put your household plan into action.

                Stay informed about the local COVID-19 situation. Be aware of temporary school dismissals in your area,
                as this may affect your household’s daily routine.

                Continue practicing everyday preventive actions. Cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue and wash your
                hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use a hand
                sanitizer that contains 60% alcohol. Clean frequently touched surfaces and objects daily using a regular
                household detergent and water.

                Notify your workplace as soon as possible if your regular work schedule changes. Ask to work from home
                or take leave if you or someone in your household gets sick with COVID-19 symptoms, or if your child’s
                school is dismissed temporarily. Learn how businesses and employers can plan for and respond to
                COVID-19.

                Stay in touch with others by phone or email. If you have a chronic medical condition and live alone, ask
                family, friends, and health care providers to check on you during an outbreak. Stay in touch with family
                and friends, especially those at increased risk of developing severe illness, such as older adults and
                people with severe chronic medical conditions.

                This is a new virus and we are still learning about it, but so far, there does not seem to be a lot of illness in children. Most illness, including serious illness, is happening in adults of working age and older adults. If there cases of COVID-19 that impact your child’s school, the school may dismiss students. Keep track of school dismissals in your community. Read or watch local media sources that report school dismissals. If schools are dismissed temporarily, use alternative childcare arrangements, if needed.

                If your child/children become sick with COVID-19, notify their childcare facility or school. Talk with teachers about classroom assignments and activities they can do from home to keep up with their schoolwork.
                
                Discourage children and teens from gathering in other public places while school is dismissed to help slow the spread of COVID-19 in the community.

Read or watch local media sources that report school dismissals or and watch for communication from your child’s school. If schools are dismissed temporarily, discourage students and staff from gathering or socializing anywhere, like at a friend’s house, a favorite restaurant, or the local shopping mall.

                Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from person-to-person through respiratory droplets. Currently there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with food. Before preparing or eating food it is important to always wash your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds for general food safety. Throughout the day wash your hands after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, or going to the bathroom.

                It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.
                
                In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of spread from food products or packaging that are shipped over a period of days or weeks at ambient, refrigerated, or frozen temperatures.

Talk to your employer to discuss working from home, taking leave if you or someone in your household gets sick with COVID-19 symptoms, or if your child’s school is dismissed temporarily.
